### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently an undergraduate at The Ohio State University studying computer engineering. I'm heavily involved with Ohio State's [Underwater Robotics Team](https://org.osu.edu/osu-uwrt/), which is focused on developing autonomous underwater vehicles to compete in [RoboSub](https://robonation.org/programs/robosub/).

I have a wide range of interests and skills involving:
 * Microcontroller Firmware Development
 * Reverse engineering and hacking hardware to add additional features
 * PCB Design and Assembly
 * FPGA development with Verilog
 * Developing a wide range of tools to streamline development and testing

Check out my repositories pinned below for some of the work I have done:
 * [titan_firmware](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/titan_firmware): Firmware for the RP2040 microcontrollers on the Underwater Robotics Team, written in C after I switched the team from micropython to enable more advanced features.
 * [electric_boogaloo](https://github.com/osu-uwrt/electric_boogaloo): Contains the board designs for Underwater Robotics, including the Tempest Mark 2 electronics which I lead the design for, as well as the Tempest Mark 2 Smart Battery Housing MCU board, one of the boards I personally designed.
* [SWTPCSequencer](https://github.com/rjp5th/SWTPCSequencer): A music sequencer I wrote for [Look Mum No Computer's SWTPC 6809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA4Z7n_I14A) as an assembly and emulation exercise.
